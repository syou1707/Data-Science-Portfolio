# Sherry You's Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Sherry You and I am currently a Masters of Management Analytics Candidate at the University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management. I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's of Commerce, specializing in management with focuses on finance and data science.

In this repository, you can find the various data science-related projects I completed during the third and fourth years of my undergraduate studies and some projects I completed for the Analytics Colloquia in my graduate program. I have separated my projects into the following folders based on the course that I have taken:

Graduate Course Project
1. Garbage Classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT) (RSM8521 Leveraging AI and Deep Learning Tools in Marketing)
2. BioPharma Case Study using PuLP and Gurobi (RSM8423 Optimizing Supply Chain Management and Logistics)

Graduate Colloquia Projects
1. Social Network Analysis (RSM8431 Analytics Colloquia) - Project
2. Python ArcGIS (RSM8431 Analytics Colloquia) - Project
3. Cloud Computing (RSM8431 Analytics Colloquia) - Assignment
4. APIs (RSM8431 Analytics Colloquia) - Assignment

Undergraduate Course Projects
1. Machine Learning and Data Mining (ECO480) - Research Project
2. Management Analytics for Service and Healthcare Management (RSM412) - Projects
3. Machine Learning in Finance (RSM338) - Projects

Interest Projects
1. SNA and GNNs
- This folder contains the code and material for an interest project, "Identifying Illegal Wildlife Trafficking Networks using Social Network Analysis and Graph Neural Networks"
- Constructed graphs, implemented Leiden algorithm for community detection and built a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) to detect illegal wildlife trafficking networks. Currently fine-tuning the HGNN and testing different convolutional layers such as EGATConv and GINEConv.
